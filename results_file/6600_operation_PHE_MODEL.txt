ENHANCED CACHE STATES SUMMARY
• Modified (M): Dirty data requiring writeback
• Shared (S): Clean data with multiple readers
• Invalid (I): No valid data
• Used (U): Cross-cluster read, ONE-TIME use only
• UpdatedOnce (UP): Cross-cluster write, ONE-TIME use only
• PHN Cached (P): Data cached at PHN level

ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS
✓ Reduced global HN traffic through PHN caching
✓ Improved locality with cluster-based management  
✓ One-time use states prevent stale cross-cluster hits
✓ Dual-write maintains consistency across clusters
✓ Enhanced performance tracking and analytics
